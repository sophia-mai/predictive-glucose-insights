# Glucose Prediction Model
A personalized AI system leveraging Dexcom Clarity time series data for glucose forecasting and meal impact prediction.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a personalized glucose prediction and meal recommendation system using of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from Dexcom Clarity reports. The dataset contains glucose readings every 5 minutes along with detailed food logs and contextual information (e.g., time, meal content, and nutrition). 

By combining time series analysis and machine learning, this system seeks to understand how daily behaviors affect blood glucose trends and to provide recommendations for improving glycemic stability.

## Data Sources
### 1. Dexcom CGM Data:
Continous Glucose Monitoring data, including timestamps, glucose values, estimated insulin, and estimated carb values.

### 2. Apple Helath Data:
